PREFACE.


This work is based upon notes and diagrams
which were prepared by the writer with no
more ambitious object, originally, than to help
his railway students toward the obtainment of
clear <i>general</i> notions upon the important subject
of the slide valve.

For practical demonstration of the functions
and operation of the slide valve, a large sectional
model engine, with provision for variation
of the operation of its parts, is very valuable;
but it seems to the writer to be desirable
that each student should have in his own possession
a model to cogitate upon, and that his
model should give him, graphically, results
which should be not merely qualitative, but
also, in some degree, <i>quantitative</i>, to enable
him to institute comparisons between the
actions of different valves operated under varying
conditions. With this end in view, the
writer conceived the idea of using on a base-board
-----File: f04.png---------------------------------------------------------
a rotary disc to represent a crank-shaft,
together with the idea of obtaining concentric
circular diagrams of results (see fig. 21, for instance)
by using a crank-arm marked on the
disc as an index-finger, and recording on the
base-board the beginnings and ends of the arcs
swept through by the crank in the various distribution-periods.
Following upon this, it was
thought that the eccentric and its rod could be
eliminated by bringing the disc under the valve
and fixing upon the valve a rigid slotted arm
to extend down across the face of the disc and
engage a pin on the latter, so that rotation of
the disc would cause reciprocation of the
slotted arm and the valve. This promised, however,
to be unmechanical and expensive, and
was discarded in favor of the model described
in Chapter I., which comprises the simple
method of correlating (as described in Chapter
II.) the movements of valve and crank-shaft
by scales adjacent to each, so that the reading
given by the valve on the valve-scale at any
position of the valve would show what position
on the eccentric-scale the eccentric ought correspondingly
to occupy. The fact that this involved
a step-by-step adjustment of the valve
and shaft alternately was found in practice to
be advantageous rather than the reverse.
-----File: f05.png---------------------------------------------------------

As to the diagrams and sketches, the writer
has sought, in some of them, to clear up graphically
some of the incidental minor difficulties
related to the subject; see, for instance, figs. 12
and 13, illustrating “Order of Cranks,” fig. 22
on “Width of Port”; also compare figs. 23,
24, and 25, “Double-ported Valve,” and see
fig. 37, which last is in effect a graphical summary
of results from nearly all the different
examples which precede it.

Fig. 36, which concerns the reversal of an
engine in motion under steam, will probably
have a special interest to students of the locomotive.

INTRODUCTION TO AMERICAN
EDITION.


There is no more important part of the
steam-engine than the valve—the part which
determines when and for how long the steam
shall be admitted to the cylinder, how long it
shall stay there and how long it shall be allowed
for leaving. And the principles which
should govern the construction of the valve of
an engine in order that the steam shall be properly
admitted and released are the same for
American, English, French and German engines.
The principles of their construction and
action are the same, but the details vary. The
action of every steam-engine depends upon its
valve, and hence it is important that every engineer
of whatever country should be thoroughly
conversant with the principles of the
construction of valves of different types;
should know the meaning of “lap,” “lead,”
“advance,” etc.; and should know how a
-----File: p02.png---------------------------------------------------------
change of one of these will affect the others
and the admission and release of the steam.
One of the best ways to learn all about valves
and valve motions is to study them with the
aid of sectional models, made so that the inside
as well as the outside of the parts may be
seen, but such models are difficult to obtain except
at considerable cost. Diagrams, such as
are so freely used in this work, rank next to
models in utility and as a means of enabling
one to thoroughly understand the workings of
the different parts of machines. The use of
diagrams requires no knowledge of mathematics,
and enables explanations to be presented in
a clear, concise manner. From an educational
point of view, diagrams possess an advantage
which models do not, as they make one think
more. Their use gets one in the habit of forming
mental pictures of the parts of the machines
discussed, and thus enables one to more
readily and quickly think out the effect of a
change in one part on other parts. And this
ability to picture in the mind the various relations
of the parts to one another is absolutely
necessary in order that these relations may be
thoroughly understood. The man who is accustomed
to work out his problems from diagrams
and drawings, reasons from cause to
-----File: p03.png---------------------------------------------------------
effect and from effect to cause; while the man
who must have a model to work with, works
on the “cut-and-try” method.

This little book is confined strictly to an explanation
of the principles which underlie the
action of the different types of slide valves.
The plain, simple D-valve, as it is called in this
country, without lap or lead, is first taken up
and discussed; and gradually lap and lead are
introduced, and the effect of each upon the admission,
the cut-off, the release, and the compression
is fully worked out and shown. Then
other types of slide valves are taken up and
discussed. The advance is made step by step,
from the most simple form of slide valve to the
more complicated forms used for attaining certain
results not so easily attained by the use of
the simple forms.

The form of multi-ported valve shown in
fig. 25 is so much like the Giddings valve used
on the Russell and some other single-valve engines,
that any one reading the explanation
given here will have no trouble in understanding
the Giddings valve (shown in fig. 26).

The multiple admission valve is used to such
an extent in America that it is but proper that
a few words should be said of it, and that the
most common form of multiple admission
-----File: p04.png---------------------------------------------------------
valves should be discussed. And hence the
Straight Line and the Woodbury valves are
shown in figs. 27 and 28.

There are so many engines in this country
in the front rank of automatic, high-speed engines
which use piston-valves, that a treatise
on slide valves would be incomplete without
some mention of this type of slide valve. The
form of piston-valve shown in fig. 30, in which
the steam is admitted at the middle and exhausted
at the ends, is well known to all engineers
who have used an Ide or an Ideal engine.
The valve used on these engines is shown in
fig. 31.

Many American engineers prefer engines on
which the cut-off may be changed without in
any way affecting the lead, release, or compression,
and, therefore, the description of the
Meyer valve will be read with interest. Many
will recognize at once in the valve used on the
Watertown engine the Meyer valve in almost
its original form, and in the valve of the Buckeye
engine (shown in section in fig. 39), the
Meyer valve in a modified form.

THE SLIDE VALVE.




CHAPTER I.

THE SIMPLE SLIDE.


The slide valve has always been regarded by
the writer as the <i>pons asinorum</i> of the student
of the steam-engine. His own early attempts
at crossing that bridge were greatly facilitated
by the simple little device to be presently submitted
to the reader; with the aid of this expedient
the student may easily obtain clear
notions upon all the functions and operations
of the slide valve, at a nominal cost, and with
but a small expenditure of time and trouble.

It is necessary that at the outset the nature
of the construction above alluded to should be
clearly appreciated, for the reason that many of
the explanations given in the succeeding pages
are referred thereto.

In passing, it may be remarked that much
of the difficulty which the ordinary student
-----File: p06.png---------------------------------------------------------
experiences in the study of valves and valve
gear arises because he approaches the subject
with a false impression that it is of necessity
a difficult one; this idea is generated on the
-----File: p07.png---------------------------------------------------------
one hand in the atmosphere of mystery which
in the shop is made to surround the matter,
and on the other hand by the somewhat formidable
aspect of most of the geometrical treatises
on the subject. If the beginner can bring
himself to believe that the slide valve is nothing
more complex than a sliding shutter with
a cavity in its face, travelling backwards and
forwards over three ports, the outermost of
which are alternately opened to steam and
placed in communication with the central exhaust-port,
he will have made a satisfactory
commencement.

Take a piece of stout white cardboard and
upon it set out an enlarged copy of fig. 1.[1]

[Illustration: <sc>Fig. 1.</sc>—Explanatory Diagram.]

[Footnote 1: See also fig. 41.]

The upper portion of this diagram represents
a section taken at right angles to the
port-face through a set of steam and exhaust-ports
as ordinarily arranged; the graduated
ring beneath the section will receive consideration
later.

Postponing for the moment the further investigation
of fig. 1, reference should here be
made to figs. 2, 3, and 4.

Fig. 2 shows, in perspective, a cylinder and
valve-chest with parts removed to make clear
the manner in which the two steam-ports

-----File: p08.png---------------------------------------------------------
(S_{1}S_{2}) at the upper ends of the two outer passages
(P_{1}P_{2}) afford a communication between
the valve-chest (VC) and the opposite ends
(C_{1}C_{2}) of the cylinder (C), and to show the
passage from the central exhaust-port (EP) to
the outlet (O) at which the exhaust steam is
discharged. The relationship between this view
and the upper part of fig. 1 will be obvious
upon a comparison of the two.

[Illustration: <sc>Fig. 2.</sc>—Perspective Section of Steam-Engine Cylinder.]

A typical slide valve is shown in section, in
-----File: p09.png---------------------------------------------------------
its place above the ports in fig. 2, and separately
in figs. 3 and 4. From these latter, the large
ratio of the width to the length of the valve is
apparent, and it will be seen from fig. 2 that
the ports are correspondingly made wide and
short. This arrangement enables a small linear
-----File: p10.png---------------------------------------------------------
movement of the valve to effect the uncovering
of a large area of port, and to secure free
passage for the steam with but a small amount
of valve-travel, and so to reduce to a minimum
the work unavoidably wasted in overcoming
friction between the port-face and the valve
heavily loaded by the pressure of steam upon
its back.

*[Illustration: <sc>Figs.</sc> 3 and 4.—Separate Views of the Slide Valve.]

Let us return now to fig. 1. Draw, near the
edge of a strip of moderately stiff paper, the
section of the elementary form of slide valve
illustrated by fig. 5, taking its dimensions from
the ports of fig. 1, so that the two views agree
in the manner indicated. By sliding this diagram
backwards and forwards across the ports
of fig. 1, the following explanation of the action
of this, the simplest form of slide valve, will
be readily appreciated.

[Illustration: <sc>Fig. 5.</sc>—Section of Slide Valve.]

This valve has first to open one port to
-----File: p11.png---------------------------------------------------------
steam, and when the steam thus admitted has
forced the piston towards the opposite end of
the cylinder, to put the same port in communication
with the exhaust, while opening the
other port to the steam which effects the return
movement of the piston. The duration of the
admission of steam is the same as that of the
exhaust, the admission, owing to the dimensions
of the valve in relation to the ports, necessarily
taking place on one side of the piston
simultaneously with the occurrence of exhaust
from the other side (see fig. 6). The travel
of this rudimentary valve equals twice the
amount to which the port is opened to steam.
It happens to open each port fully in this case
(although this is rarely the case with modern
slide valves), so that the “travel” equals twice
-----File: p12.png---------------------------------------------------------
the width of steam-port: <i>twice</i>, because (starting
with the valve in its central position, as
shown in fig. 5) it has to move to the right,
say, by an amount equal to the <i>width</i> of <i>the
left-hand</i> port, in order to open that port fully
to steam, and then it moves back again and
travels to the other side of the central position
by an equal amount, in order to open the
equally dimensioned right-hand port to steam.
In fig. 6 the valve is shown at the two extremes
of its travel, in full lines at one end, and in
dotted lines at the other end.

*[Illustration: <sc>Fig. 6.</sc>—Section showing Position of Slide Valve in relation
to Steam and Exhaust-Ports.]
-----File: p13.png---------------------------------------------------------




CHAPTER II.

THE ECCENTRIC A CRANK. SPECIAL MODEL TO
GIVE QUANTITATIVE RESULTS.


The necessary travel of the valve is given to
it by means of an eccentric, which is keyed
upon or formed as part of the crank-shaft. The
eccentric is, in effect, a crank, whose throw
equals the amount of eccentricity of the sheave.
This may not be obvious; let us investigate a
little. Suppose that we have a big crank-shaft,
and want to put a little crank in the middle of
it (for this is what happens in the case of a
steam-engine, the travel of the valve being such
that a crank of the usual [** in-line illustration] form
would be disproportionate to the shaft of which
it formed part—like fig. 7, perhaps). Now,
that such a shaft would be extremely weak at
the pin goes without saying. Imagine, that
to lessen the weakness the crank-pin of this
little crank is made of greater diameter, as in
fig. 8, or even more so, as in fig. 9; still we get
the same result, which is that the <i>throw</i> of the
-----File: p14.png---------------------------------------------------------
crank remains the same, and equals the distance
of the centre of the crank-pin from the
centre of the crank-shaft—<i>i.e.</i>, the amount that
this crank-pin is “<i>ex-centric</i>,” out of centre,
and <i>the eccentric sheave being simply an exaggerated
crank-pin</i> we get back to our original
statement that it is virtually a crank whose
throw equals the half-travel of the valve, which
-----File: p15.png---------------------------------------------------------
in turn equals the amount of eccentricity of
the sheave.

*[Illustration: <sc>Fig. 7.</sc>—Half-travel of Valve.]

[Illustration: <sc>Fig. 8.</sc>—Half-travel of Valve.]

[Illustration: <sc>Fig. 9.</sc>—Half-travel of Valve.]

Being fixed to the crank-shaft and moving
with it, always in a fixed relationship to the
main crank, the eccentric operates the valve
in the necessary accordance with the movement
of the crank and piston, as will presently be
explained.
-----File: p16.png---------------------------------------------------------

Returning now to fig. 5, it must be understood
that a valve of the type exemplified
therein must be in the <i>middle</i> of its travel
whenever the piston is at <i>either end</i> of its
stroke. The reason for this must be clearly
-----File: p17.png---------------------------------------------------------
appreciated for the sake of what follows hereafter;
it may be arrived at very easily with the
aid of fig. 1. Put a disc of card in the circle
provided in that figure, and let it turn about
a drawing-pin stuck through its centre; this
disc is the equivalent of a crank-shaft. A
crank-arm (C) may be permanently marked
upon it in ink, as in fig. 10; another arm, which
may be marked upon it in pencil, will serve
to represent a “valve-crank,” the equivalent
of the eccentric by which the valve is to be
operated.

*[Illustration: <sc>Fig. 10.</sc>]

Actual connection between that valve-crank
and the valve being dispensed with, some
means for making the movement of the valve
correspond accurately with that of its crank
must be provided. This provision is made by
the numbered scales[2] in fig. 1; the circular
scale within which the card disc revolves is
numbered in correspondence with scales on the
ports, and to these latter an arrow on the strip
-----File: p18.png---------------------------------------------------------
of paper which carries the valve is adjusted
(see also fig. 10). To find the position in
which to mark the arrow on the valve, put the
latter in the centre of its travel and mark the
arrow-head just above the “0” on the No. 1
scale. When the disc is turned, the end of
the eccentric-arm or valve-crank travels with
it around the circular scale. When the eccentric-arm
-----File: p19.png---------------------------------------------------------
is moved step by step around the
circle to the various numbered graduations, the
valve must be moved step by step to bring its
arrow-head to the corresponding numbers on
the horizontal scale on the ports. Thus the eccentric
and valve, although not moved simultaneously,
as they would be if a rod connected
them, are kept in accurate relationship whilst
moved independently. If the reader will now
read the preface, which he has probably
skipped, he will the more readily appreciate
the principle of this arrangement.

[Footnote 2: The horizontal scales on the port-faces are obtained by
projecting up equidistant circumferential marks from various
circles having different valve-cranks for their radii. The scale
(No. 1) is for the elementary form of valve, without lap; it serves
also for link-motion in mid-gear; No. 2 is for a valve having
outside lap; and No. 3 is for link-motion “linked up.” The
student need not, unless he pleases, trouble himself to investigate
the construction of the diagram, which is drawn to scale,
so that if copied accurately it will serve to give him the demonstrations
desired.]

Further, taking the main crank-arm (C) as
an index-finger, the position of its end at the
points of cut-off, release, etc., with different
valves and eccentrics, may be marked in pencil
on the circular scale, or better, on a piece of
tracing-paper interposed between the disc and
that scale; by this means the student will obtain
circular diagrams enabling him to compare
the results due to different settings and proportions
of gear, and he will also discover in
what manner those results are affected by individual
elements of the mechanism in any given
example.
-----File: p20.png---------------------------------------------------------




CHAPTER III.

ADVANCE OF THE ECCENTRIC.


Assume a horizontal engine, with the main
crank moved into a horizontal position so that
the piston would be at, say, the left-hand end
of its stroke. Assume also that the engine is
at rest, and put the valve in the centre of its
travel (as in fig. 5), when its faces exactly
cover the steam-ports and its cavity covers
the bridges and the exhaust-port; the first
movement of the valve is wanted to be to the
<i>right</i>, in order to admit steam to the left-hand
end of the cylinder to move the piston also to
the right, no matter whether the crank-shaft
is to have negative or positive rotation. Now,
a valve of this pattern evidently will not admit
steam to the cylinder to <i>start</i> the movement
of the piston (supposing that the engine has
not yet been started), which will therefore
have to be helped by some external agency;
admitting this as a point which shall be touched
again presently, place the crank next, so that
-----File: p21.png---------------------------------------------------------
the piston would be at the opposite end of its
stroke; the valve, which had to move to the
right as explained, must have come back into
the position whence it started, and be in readiness
to move equally to the <i>left</i>, afterwards
returning once more to the central position
by the time that the piston gets back to the
left-hand end of the cylinder. Hence we see
that, whenever the piston is at either end of its
stroke, this valve must be in the middle of its
travel.

If this be granted, we may proceed further:—Having
the piston at the right-hand end of
its stroke, for instance, draw a line on the disc
at right angles with the crank (see fig. 10);
this will represent two “eccentric-arms” of
the necessary throw if each arm equals in
length the half-travel of the valve; either of
them at present suits the position of the valve,
which is in the middle of its travel. Choose,
now, the direction in which your crank-shaft
shall rotate; let us suppose, for example, that
it shall have “right-handed” rotation, and
place an arrow on the disc to indicate the direction
of rotation. Under these conditions
the upper eccentric will <i>follow</i> the crank round,
operating the valve to close the right-hand port
and open the left-hand one, admitting steam to
-----File: p22.png---------------------------------------------------------
stop the engine. Cross this upper arm out,
then, for manifestly we have to use the lower
eccentric, which, going ahead of the crank,
will cause the valve to open the right-hand
port when required. But now conversely,
suppose that the engine is to be run in the
opposite direction; the upper eccentric (represented
by the crossed-out line) now goes ahead
of the crank, and gives the valve motion in
the right direction, consequently the lower
one must now go out of use, for under the
altered conditions of working it tends to move
the valve in the wrong direction. The deduction
from this reasoning is, that in whichever
direction an engine runs, the eccentric used for
the time being must be set in advance of the
crank, and that advance must be <i>at least 90°</i>.

If it were less than 90° the wrong port
would be opened—the port at the opposite end
of the cylinder to that at which the piston
might happen to be. This effect may be shown
by purposely giving the eccentric less advance.

The amount which the angle between the
eccentric and the crank exceeds 90° is the
“angle of advance”; and the distance which
the valve is moved from mid-position when the
piston is at the end of the stroke is the “linear
advance.”
-----File: p23.png---------------------------------------------------------

Because of the necessity for different settings
of the eccentric for different directions of
rotation of the crank, engines required to be
reversible usually have either:

/#
(1) Means for shifting the position of a
single eccentric upon the shaft, that
it may always be placed so as to lead
the crank. Or

(2) Two eccentrics fixed upon the crank-shaft
so that one of them is always
ahead of the crank in whichever direction
it rotates, mechanism being
arranged in connection with the eccentrics,
so that the valve can be
driven by the leading eccentric, or
operated by the conjoint action of
both eccentrics. Or

(3) Radial or other special valve gears.
#/

The simple form of slide valve shown in
fig. 10 does not permit of the economical use
of steam, inasmuch as it allows steam at full
pressure to follow the piston for the whole of
the stroke, and does not admit of the use of
its expansive properties, for the simple reason
that, at the instant the admission of steam
ceases, the exhaust of the same body of steam
must immediately commence, as may be clearly
seen from the circular diagram.
-----File: p24.png---------------------------------------------------------




CHAPTER IV.

DEAD CENTRE. ORDER OF CRANKS. CUSHIONING
AND LEAD.


It is desirable at this point to clear the ground
by touching for a moment upon one or two
elementary matters which, if not now explained,
might cause confusion subsequently.

<i>Dead Centres.</i>—A crank is said to be “on
the centre” or “on the dead centre” when the
connecting-rod and crank are in line, and this
occurs twice in every revolution, as shown in
fig. 11.

[Illustration: <sc>Fig. 11.</sc>—Dead Centre—Connecting Rod and Crank in Line.]

<i>Right-hand Crank to Lead.</i>—The phrases
“right-hand crank to lead,” or “left-hand
crank to lead,” are sometimes used, and are
confusing to beginners; the “leading” crank
is that one which leads <i>when the engine is running
ahead</i>. In most two-crank engines one
of the cranks will be a quarter of a revolution
(or <i>less</i> than <i>half</i> a revolution, where the
cranks are not set at 90 degs.) in advance of
its neighbour, and will, therefore, <i>lead</i> it in the
direction in which it should go. Of course,
-----File: p25.png---------------------------------------------------------
-----File: p26.png---------------------------------------------------------
that neighbour might be said to lead the other
by being <i>three-quarters</i> of a revolution in advance
(or <i>more</i> than <i>half</i> a revolution, where
the cranks are not set at 90 degs.), and this is
where a little confusion sometimes arises; the
leading crank must always be taken as that
one which is <i>less than half a revolution in advance
of its fellow when the engine is running
ahead</i>, and in locomotives and similar engines
is “left-hand” or “right-hand,” according as
it lies to the left or right of a spectator looking
from behind the crank-shaft towards the cylinders.
(See fig. 12, which shows two arrangements
of the driving cranks of an English locomotive.
The cylinders are supposed to be to
the right of the wheels.)

[Illustration: <sc>Fig. 12.</sc>—Order of Cranks.]
-----File: p27.png---------------------------------------------------------

The accompanying diagram (fig. 13) will perhaps
serve to make clear without further explanation
the meaning of the expression, used
with reference to three-crank marine engines,
of “order of cranks, high, intermediate, low,”
or “order of cranks, high, low, intermediate,”
as the case may be.

[Illustration: <sc>Fig. 13.</sc>—Order of Cranks.]

Let us revert here to one of the points previously
noted, which was that the simple valve,
when we had it in connection with an eccentric
set 90 degs. in advance of the crank, would not
admit steam to the cylinder at the exact commencement
of the stroke, <i>i.e.</i>, when the crank
is on either of the “dead centres.”
-----File: p28.png---------------------------------------------------------

Keeping this fact in mind, we will consider
the matters of

<i>Cushioning and Lead.</i>—It has long been
found desirable (especially in quick-running
engines) that the motion of the returning piston
should be opposed as it arrives at either
end of its stroke, so that the moving weights
of piston, piston-rod, and connecting-rod may
be “cushioned,” to prevent injurious stresses
and to conduce to easy running. To use a
homely illustration, one might say that just in
the same way is it desirable, when striking out
from the shoulder, to have one’s adversary
within range, that he may provide the necessary
“cushioning,” and so prevent stresses in
one’s arm and possible dislocations.

This “cushioning” is provided in part by
checking the exit of the exhaust steam, as will
be shown later, and in part by setting the eccentric
a little more than 90 degs. (fig. 14) in
advance of the crank, so that the valve commences
to open the port to admit steam in
front of the returning piston before it arrives
at the end of its stroke, continuing to open
the port as the piston comes to a rest, and is
started on the return stroke.

*[Illustration: <sc>Fig. 14.</sc>]

The amount to which the port is found to be
open when the piston is at the end of its stroke
-----File: p29.png---------------------------------------------------------
is called the “lead” of the valve, and it would
be expressed as “one-eighth of an inch lead,”
or “three-sixteenths of an inch lead.” etc.,
as the case might be. To set this valve for
lead, keep the piston at the end of its stroke,
and set the eccentric back until the valve is
opened to the desired lead; then the eccentric
-----File: p30.png---------------------------------------------------------
would be fixed in its newly-found position, as
shown in fig. 14. The radius of the “eccentric-arm,”
which is the lighter of the two
radial lines on the disc in fig. 14, is equal
in length to one-half of the travel of the valve,
and therefore does not reach the edge of the
disc, at which, however, there is a short guiding-mark
in the line of the eccentric-arm
“produced.” By using this guiding-mark and
moving the arrow-head of the valve over the
scale on the ports, in correspondence with the
movement of the guiding-mark on the edge of
the disc within the circular scale, the valve,
the main crank (C), and the eccentric can be
operated in concord, very much as if they were
mechanically connected.

The explanation just given of the meaning
of lead, and of its effect, should be borne in
mind, as we shall presently have to consider it
in conjunction with other matters, for, as has
been said, there is something more than
“lead” employed in the production of cushioning.
-----File: p31.png---------------------------------------------------------




CHAPTER V.

EXPANSION—INSIDE AND OUTSIDE LAP AND
LEAD; ADVANCE AFFECTED THEREBY—COMPRESSION.


<i>Expansion.</i>—In order that the expansive properties
of steam may be utilised, it must be cut
off before the piston arrives at the end of its
stroke, and on being cut off <i>must not be allowed
to commence exhausting immediately</i>.
but must be confined in the cylinder, in order
that by expanding it may force the piston
further before it. The old valve, as we have
seen it, did not allow this, and to effect it the
faces of the valve are lengthened, so that after
the steam is cut off by the edge (<i>a</i>) of the
valve (fig. 15) the steam is confined, and expands
in the cylinder until the edge (<i>b</i>) arrives
at <i>c</i>, when exhaust immediately commences.
Now put the piston at the end of its stroke,
and put the new valve in a central position
(fig. 16). The distance that the valve, when
in this central position, <i>overlaps the outer edge</i>
-----File: p32.png---------------------------------------------------------
of the steam-port, is called the “outside or
steam lap,” or more commonly the “lap” of
the valve, that is, the distance <i>d a</i> (fig. 16).

[Illustration: <sc>Fig. 15.</sc>]

*[Illustration: <sc>Fig. 16.</sc>]

The first thing noticeable is that this valve
must be given considerably more travel than
the old one, as, to open fully each port to
steam, we have to bring the edge <i>a</i> to <i>c</i>, first
for one end of the valve and then for the other,
so that the travel of this valve must be <i>twice
the distance from a to c</i>—<i>i.e.</i> (lap <i>plus</i> port-opening)
× 2, whereas for the old valve it
was the distance from <i>d</i> to <i>c</i> which had to be
multiplied by two to give the travel.

Increased travel means increased throw of
the eccentric, and we draw on the disc in
fig. 16 two longer eccentric-arms than before
-----File: p33.png---------------------------------------------------------
(the bolder dotted lines) for the forward and
backward eccentrics. We want “lead” with
this valve, and we must therefore give each
eccentric more advance than the 90 degs.
shown. Now with the old valve we give each
eccentric an advance upon the 90 degs. which
was determined solely by the lead, no lap being
then in question; but we now have a lap to
deal with, therefore each eccentric must be
set on past 90 degs. until it first has drawn
-----File: p34.png---------------------------------------------------------
edge <i>a</i> of the lap to the outer edge of the port,
and then still further until the edge <i>a</i> gives
the necessary “lead.” Hence we see that the
linear advance of the eccentric = <i>lap plus lead</i>,
so as to draw the valve out of its central position
by that amount.

<i>Travel</i>, then, depends upon <i>outside lap and
port-opening</i>, and lead does not affect it.

<i>Advance</i> depends upon <i>lap and lead</i>.

The advance of the eccentric is usually
stated by specifying the angle of advance or
the number of degrees <i>exceeding 90 degs.</i> that
the eccentric is in advance of the crank—for
instance, “an angle of advance of 10 degs.”
means 90 degs. + 10 degs. = 100 degs. in advance
of the crank.

The line of travel of the valve is sometimes
inclined to the line of travel of the piston; in
such cases, one of which is illustrated in fig. 17,
the angle of advance must, of course, be measured
from a line at right angles to the valve-travel
line, and not at right angles to the line
of piston-travel, as we have hitherto assumed.

[Illustration: <sc>Fig. 17.</sc>—Engine in which the Line of Travel of Valve is Inclined in Relation to that of the Piston.]

We must now carefully consider the further
results obtained by the use of a valve having
lap and giving lead, and whose eccentric of
<i>greater throw</i> is advanced accordingly.

We should expect cut-off to take place
-----File: p35.png---------------------------------------------------------
-----File: p36.png---------------------------------------------------------
earlier than with the old valve, for the eccentric
is advanced, and the edge <i>a</i> (fig. 15)
would arrive at <i>e</i> a little earlier than would the
edge <i>d</i> of the old valve, even without advance
of the new eccentric.

This seen, we can understand that in causing
the edge <i>a</i> (fig. 18) to reach the edge <i>e</i>
earlier in the stroke of the piston than it
otherwise would do, we shall have hastened
all the other operations so that they must
occur earlier in the stroke (not necessarily by
exactly the same amount for each, however,
as we shall see further on), hence the edge <i>b</i>
(fig. 18) arriving earlier at <i>c</i>, exhaust will
commence before the piston completes its
-----File: p37.png---------------------------------------------------------
stroke, and also in returning to the <i>right</i>
(fig. 19) the valve is earlier, and instead of
the exhaust lasting during the whole of the
return stroke some of it will be shut in by <i>b</i>
and compressed before the returning piston
until the edge <i>a</i> arrives at <i>e</i>, whereupon the
lead commences coming in on and reinforcing
the compressed steam. Thus it is that compression
and lead <i>together</i> affect the cushioning,
and consequently the piston is eased in
stopping, and the return stroke is commenced
without injurious shock or jar. A similar
operation, of course, takes place at the opposite
end of the cylinder when the piston arrives
there.

[Illustration: <sc>Fig. 18.</sc>]

[Illustration: <sc>Fig. 19.</sc>]
-----File: p38.png---------------------------------------------------------

The distribution-diagram for a valve with
lap, lead, and a suitable eccentric is given in
fig. 20, which should be compared carefully
with figs. 10 and 14.

[Illustration: <sc>Fig. 20.</sc>]

<i>Inside Lap</i>, exhaust lap, or “cover” as it is
sometimes called, is possessed by many slide
valves, and it is the amount that the valve
when in its central position overlaps the <i>inner</i>
edges of the steam-ports. Conversely,

<i>Inside Lead</i> is the amount of space left, in
certain cases, between the inner edge of the
-----File: p39.png---------------------------------------------------------
valve and the inner edge of the steam-port
when the valve is in its central position.

The amount of inside lap does not affect the
setting of the eccentric, neither does it necessitate
any alteration in the travel of the valve.
With a given cut-off, steam is confined longer
in the cylinder by a valve having inside lap
because of the lengthening of the valve-face
due to the inside lap, and compression will
commence earlier and will be of longer duration
from the same cause; exhaust being
shortened in two ways—by the amount added
to the duration of expansion at its end, and
by a similar amount added to the compression
at the commencement thereof.

Inside lead may be considered as something
taken off the exhaust edge of the valve, and
in effect, exactly the opposite to exhaust lap,
for, as may easily be seen, it shortens expansion
and compression by reason of the shortening
of the valve-face, and lengthens the
exhaust at commencement and end by the
amounts by which the operations of expansion
and compression are shortened. The left-hand
side of the valve in fig. 21 has inside lap, whilst
the right-hand side has inside lead, and the
circular distribution-diagram below compares
the distribution in the case of valves having
-----File: p40.png---------------------------------------------------------
inside lap and inside lead with the distribution
for an ordinary valve such as was considered
with reference to fig. 20. By reference to the
lower portion of fig. 21, it may be seen that
the operations of admission and cut-off are
unaffected, as they are performed by the outer
edges of the valve; but

[Illustration: <sc>Fig. 21.</sc>]
-----File: p41.png---------------------------------------------------------

/*
             {is shorter and exhaust earlier
             {  with inside lead.
Expansion    {
             {is longer and exhaust later
             {  with inside lap.

             {is later and shorter with
             {  inside lead.
Compression  {
             {is earlier and longer with
             {  inside lap.
*/

From this it will be obvious why many express
locomotives are given inside lead, and
why many good engines have inside lap.

<i>Free Exhaust.</i>—In order to give as free a
passage as possible to the exhaust steam, so
that it may leave the cylinder easily, and not
have to be forced out by the returning piston
and cause back pressure thereupon, it is customary
to make the steam-ports wider than
-----File: p42.png---------------------------------------------------------
the amount to which they are open to steam.
<i>This must on no account be confused with
inside lead</i>, which is quite a distinct matter.
The effect of having wide ports is that the
exhaust may be opened to any extent up to the
half-travel of the valve, although the steam-opening
may be much smaller, as may be
understood from the exaggerated diagram
(fig. 22), whence also should be seen that this
widening of the port does not affect the <i>duration</i>
of expansion or of any other operation
of the valve, neither does it necessitate any
allowance in the setting of the eccentric. It
simply provides a free exhaust.

[Illustration: <sc>Fig. 22.</sc>]
-----File: p43.png---------------------------------------------------------




CHAPTER VI.

DOUBLE-PORTED, MULTIPLE ADMISSION, AND
PISTON VALVES.


<i>Double-ported Valves.</i>—In large marine engines
using considerable quantities of steam
per stroke, and consequently requiring a large
amount of port-opening, the ordinary slide
valve would require an undue amount of
travel. To obviate this, each end of the cylinder
may have two steam-ports, both ports
opening into one passage as shown, and a
double-ported valve. The double-ported valve
is virtually a combination of two slide valves
in a single casting (fig. 23), one valve for the
inner set of steam-ports and the exhaust-port,
the other valve being halved, as it were, for
each outer steam-port. The exhaust cavity of
each of the outer “half-valves” having a passage
leading to the exhaust cavity of the inner
valve, both the valves exhaust into the central
port, which is widened accordingly. The
fig. 23 is merely diagrammatic, to enable the
-----File: p44.png---------------------------------------------------------
principle of this valve to be easily borne in
mind; the next drawing (fig. 24) shows in
section a double-ported valve as actually constructed,
with the exception that the valve-spindle
and its chamber are omitted in order
that the form of the valve may be more clearly
shown. The section is taken in two planes,
one upon the longitudinal centre line of the
valve, and the other (the left-hand half of
the valve) a little to the near side of the centre
line. Fig. 25 shows a sectional view of a
double-ported valve in perspective.

[Illustration: <sc>Fig. 23.</sc>—Diagram showing Flow of Steam and Exhaust
through a Double-ported Slide Valve.]

[Illustration: <sc>Fig. 24.</sc>—Vertical Section through a Double-ported
Slide Valve.]

[Illustration: <sc>Fig. 25.</sc>—Perspective view (in Section) of a Double-ported
Slide Valve.]

Now, any movement given to the “inner
valve” is given, of course, to the outer one,
so that if the inner valve be moved so as to
give, say, 2 ins. of port-opening, the outer
valve gives at the same time another 2 ins. of
port-opening; therefore, with a given movement
of a double-ported valve we get double
the amount of port-opening that we should
-----File: p45.png---------------------------------------------------------
have obtained with the ordinary valve. Hence
the travel of the double-ported valve = (lap
+ half the two port-openings) × 2; whereas
that of the ordinary valve = (lap + the port-opening
required) × 2.

The inner and outer valves of the double-ported
construction, acting simultaneously,
have each the same amount of lap; but they
give the lead between them, and the eccentric
is set with a linear advance equal to <i>one</i> of the
laps and <i>one</i> of the lead-openings. The distribution
of steam with this valve is similar
to that of the ordinary valve whose distribution-diagram
was shown in fig. 20. The different
periods are of the same duration in the
example chosen, but the operations of cutting
off steam and of opening exhaust are performed
by the edges of the inner and outer
valves instead of by a single edge as in the
ordinary valve.

-----File: p46.png---------------------------------------------------------

A valve very similar to the double-ported
valve, shown in fig. 23, is the Giddings valve
used on the Russell engines and some other
automatic high-speed engines in America. By
its peculiar construction, this valve obviates
the necessity of double steam ports, yet it is so
much like the double-ported valve that it may
be noticed here rather than under the head of
multiple admission valves, where it might be
said to properly belong. This valve accomplishes
exactly what the double-ported valve
does, and in pretty much the same way. The
Giddings valve in fig. 26 shows steam being
admitted to the right-hand end of the cylinder
and exhausted from the left-hand end. The
travel of this valve is, as in the case of the
double-ported valve = (lap + half the port
opening required) × 2. The valve should be
set with a linear advance equal to the lap plus
one-half the required lead.

[Illustration: <sc>Fig. 26.</sc>—The Giddings Valve.]

-----File: p47.png---------------------------------------------------------


MULTIPLE ADMISSION VALVES.

In America, the type of engine known as the
automatic high-speed engine is very much
used. These engines have a wide range of cut-off,
from almost 0 to 1/2 stroke, and in order to
avoid a long valve and a long travel and to
secure a quick admission and cut-off of the
steam, recourse is had to multiple admission
valves. These valves are so constructed that
when one of them is moved from midposition, a
distance equal to, say, 1/16 of an inch more than
the steam lap, the width of the opening for the
steam to pass through into the cylinder is 1/16
multiplied by the number of admissions of the
valve. Thus, if the valve is a <i>double</i> admission
valve, and it is moved 1/16 plus the steam
-----File: p48.png---------------------------------------------------------
lap from midposition, the port is opened a distance
equal to 2 × 1/16 = 1/8 of an inch.
Double admission valves are quite common
and there are also a number of quadruple admission
valves used. They are made as flat
valves and as piston valves, but all are made
with a common object in view, that is, to secure
an early cut-off and quick opening and
closing of the ports with a valve whose length
and travel shall be short.

One of the best-known forms of double admission
valves is the “Straight Line” or
“Sweet” valve, which was invented by Professor
John E. Sweet, formerly of Cornell University,
and first used by him on the Straight
Line engines. This valve is now used by a
large number of manufacturers of automatic
high-speed engines. The valve is shown in
-----File: p49.png---------------------------------------------------------
section in fig. 27, where <i>a</i> is the “cover plate,”
and <i>b</i> is the valve, proper. The valve, <i>b</i>, moves
back and forth between the cover plate, <i>a</i>, and
the valve seat. The cover plate rests on pieces
called “distance pieces,” placed at the sides of
the valve. These distance pieces are made of
such a thickness that while the cover plate cannot
touch the valve, it is so close to it as to
make a steam tight joint between the plate and
the valve. Therefore, the valve acts as a piston
of rectangular cross-section, moving back and
forth between the cover plate and the valve
seat. The result of its peculiar construction is
that a balanced flat valve is secured; a valve
which works with very little friction, as there
is no surface upon which the steam can act so
as to press the valve against the valve seat.
The cover plate is kept in place by the pressure
of the steam against its back, aided by one or
two small springs inserted between the plate
and the steam-chest cover.

[Illustration: <sc>Fig. 27.</sc>—The Straight Line Valve.]

This valve should be set so that the distance
the valve is from midposition when the piston
is at the end of its stroke, or the linear advance,
shall be equal to the steam lap plus one-half
the desired lead. The travel of the valve is
equal to twice the sum of the steam lap and
one-half the maximum opening of the port for
-----File: p50.png---------------------------------------------------------
steam, or 2 × (steam lap + 1/2 maximum opening
of port for steam).

In the case of a quadruple admission valve,
such as the Woodbury valve shown in fig. 28,
the travel is equal to twice the sum of the steam
lap and one-fourth the maximum opening of
the port for steam, or 2 × (steam lap + 1/4
maximum opening of port for steam).

[Illustration: <sc>Fig. 28.</sc>—The Woodbury Valve.]

The different phases of the movement of a
multiple admission valve are just the same as
for the ordinary slide valve, the only difference
being in the suddenness with which the ports
are opened and closed.

<i>Piston Valves.</i>—It may be readily seen that
between the ordinary flat slide valve and the
valve-seat considerable friction is set up, because
the steam pressure on the back of the
-----File: p51.png---------------------------------------------------------
valve is only partly balanced by the varying
pressure in the cylinder steam-passages acting
upon small portions of the area of the “rubbing”
or under-side of the valve; but by making
the port-faces cylindrical and making the
faces of the valve in the form of pistons, the
pressure is given no surface upon which to
press in the direction of the valve-seat; or, in
the case of hollow piston valves (an example
of which will be presently illustrated), although
the steam has access to the interior of
the tube, pressure on parts thereof is balanced
by an equal pressure in an opposite direction
upon exactly opposite parts, and therefore is
confined to stressing the valve and has no tendency
to force any part of it on to the valve-seat.

In the plain piston valve shown (fig. 29)
the faces are formed by the two valve pistons,
which work in a cylinder wherein steam and
exhaust openings are made.

[Illustration: <sc>Fig. 29.</sc>]

Sometimes the steam-supply enters <i>between</i>
the two pistons, as in figs. 30 and 31, exhaust
taking place into the spaces at the ends of the
valve, which spaces are connected by passages
formed in the valve, which is tubular, as
shown. In such valves the steam-lap must be
put upon the <i>inner</i> edges of the valve pistons,
-----File: p52.png---------------------------------------------------------
for the steam and exhaust edges have their
positions reversed; and the lead will also be
given by the inner edges.

*[Illustration: <sc>Fig. 30.</sc>]

[Illustration: <sc>Fig. 31.</sc>—The Ide Valve.]

The eccentrics for a valve with internal
steam-supply must be placed 180 degs. in
advance of the positions which they would
occupy if the valve were of similar proportions,
but with <i>external</i> steam-supply, for the
reason that the internally supplied valve must
-----File: p53.png---------------------------------------------------------
be moving <i>up</i>, for instance, when the ordinary
valve would be moving <i>down</i>, and <i>vice versa</i>.

If the valve be an externally supplied valve,
but driven from one end of a two-armed
rocking-shaft, the valve gear actuating the
other end, as in American locomotive practice,
the eccentrics must, for obvious reasons, be
set 180 degs. in advance of their usual position.

Fig. 30 is given by the kind permission of
Messrs. W. Denny & Company, the well-known
Clyde ship-builders, and it possesses many
points of interest, one of which is that the
packing in the valve-spindle stuffing-box below
the valve, and not shown in the drawing, is
subject only to the influence of the temperature
and pressure of exhaust steam, instead
of to that of the higher temperature and pressure
of the supply steam; this is a matter of
importance, having in view the high pressures
of steam which are now used.

Further, it may be seen that the upper piston
of the valve is of greater area than the
lower one, and that the high-pressure steam
entering between the two pistons will consequently
exert a total pressure upward upon
the larger piston greater in amount than the
downward pressure exerted upon the lower
-----File: p54.png---------------------------------------------------------
and smaller one; thus the valve has a tendency
to rise, so long as steam is on. This upward
tendency balances wholly or in part the downward
tendency due to the weight of the valve,
which has not to be lifted by the valve gear,
which may be of a lighter character than
usual, and give less trouble in working, owing
-----File: p55.png---------------------------------------------------------
to diminution of wear and tear. The valve-spindle
of the ordinary flat valve is sometimes
prolonged (where the valve works vertically)
to end in a small piston exposed to steam
pressure, and acting so as to balance the
weight of the valve.

In the “Joy” assistant-cylinder, a balance-piston
is provided with special passages which,
in the movement of the valve-spindle, are
brought opposite ports in the assistant-cylinder
wall, so that steam is let in to propel the
balance-piston up or down, and thereby assist
the valve gear in each stroke. The balance-piston
acts as its own exhaust valve in sliding
over exhaust-ports in the assistant-cylinder
wall.
-----File: p56.png---------------------------------------------------------

Fig. 31 shows the piston valve used in
America on the well-known Ide and Ideal engines.
It is very similar to the valve shown in
fig. 30, and has the same advantages which
have been pointed out as belonging to that
valve. As, however, it is principally used on
horizontal engines, the two pistons are made
of the same diameter, in order to secure a perfectly
balanced valve.
-----File: p57.png---------------------------------------------------------




CHAPTER VII.

THE EFFECT OF ALTERATIONS TO VALVE AND
ECCENTRIC.


<i>Advance of the Eccentric.</i>—It should here be
established that to any given example of valve,
ports, and eccentric (leaving the piston out
of consideration for a moment) belongs a certain
cycle of operations, the occurrence of these
operations and their <i>duration, expressed in
fractions of a revolution of the rotating eccentric</i>,
being constant for a given case,[3] but the
fraction of stroke traversed by the <i>piston</i>
between or during any of these operations
of the valve will depend upon <i>where</i> in the
stroke of the piston the cycle of operations is
started, taking any convenient operation as
-----File: p58.png---------------------------------------------------------
being the commencement of the cycle, for the
speed of the piston rises from <i>nil</i> at the commencement
of its stroke to a maximum near
the middle, falling again to <i>nil</i> at the end.

[Footnote 3: To make the idea clear one might plot these operations
round a circle representing one revolution of the eccentric,
when it would be seen that the operations of the <i>valve</i> could
be considered quite independently of those of the piston—then
it would remain to show what the piston might do, or have done
upon it, by comparing its motion under varying conditions
with the <i>unvarying</i> operations of the valve, in the manner explained
later.]

Now we may go on to consider the effect
of increasing the advance of an eccentric beyond
that which it would ordinarily have
(fig. 32). If we suppose our eccentric and
valve to give us a cut-off at C and an exhaust
at E, expansion lasting 0.17 of the stroke (as
shown in full lines, fig. 32), and that by advancing
the eccentric we get a cut-off at C^1
0.14 earlier, we must not expect to find that
exhaust also will be 0.14 earlier (dotted lines,
fig. 32), for although the exhaust edge of the
valve always gives exhaust at a certain constant
period of time later than steam is cut
off by the steam edge, yet in that interval the
speed of the piston slackens less in this second
case than in the first example, and it
therefore travels through a greater distance
than in the same time-interval taken later in
the stroke in the first case. Hence, with increased
advance we get <i>earlier</i> cut-off, with
expansion of <i>lengthened duration</i> because <i>exhaust
is not earlier in the same degree</i>, neither
are all the other operations performed by the
valve, although they each commence earlier
-----File: p59.png---------------------------------------------------------
and last longer in the stroke, lead included,
but admission, of course, excepted. <i>The idea
may, perhaps, be more easily grasped by keeping
the eccentric and valve in view at an unaltering
standard of reference, and when it is
desired to consider the effect of advancing the
-----File: p60.png---------------------------------------------------------
eccentric, to imagine instead that it is the setting
of the main crank which is altered</i>—which
in effect is the same thing, and is, perhaps,
easier to reason out.

*[Illustration: <sc>Fig. 32.</sc>]

<i>Lengthening or Shortening the Eccentric
Rod—Shifting the Valve on its Spindle.</i>—Starting
with the valve in its central position,
and lengthening or shortening the eccentric
rod or shifting the valve on its spindle, or
combining both operations in the same sense,
the distance between the centre of the crank-shaft
and the centre of the valve is altered,
and the travel of the valve is shifted bodily to
the right or left, <i>i.e.</i>, the valve when in the
centre of its travel (the extent of travel remaining
of course unaltered) will be either
further from or nearer to the crank-shaft than
before, while the position of the ports remains
unaltered; therefore the arrow upon the valve
at its centre (see fig. 16) lies to the right or
left of the centre line of the port-face, and,
that arrow being no longer appropriate as a
pointer at mid-travel to the zero of the scale
on the ports, we must adopt as our index-finger
the graduation mark made adjacent to
the arrow and lying over the said zero, in
order that when the disc may indicate that
the valve should move, say, from 0 to 6 the
-----File: p61.png---------------------------------------------------------
new mark or index-finger, and not the arrow,
may be given that movement.

If the valve had previously been properly
set for lead, and the alteration shifted it 1/8 in.
to the left, for example, we should find that
the lead at the left-hand end would be diminished
by that amount, and that subsequently,
at cut-off, release, and compression, for both
ends of the cylinder, the valve would always
be found 1/8 in. to the left of its proper position.
The result would be, as shown in fig. 33, that:
At left-hand of cylinder (see lines of dashes):—

/*

taking place as the valve moves <i>from</i>

dots):—

*/

Compression commences earlier, for it occurs
whilst the valve is moving <i>to</i> the left.
-----File: p62.png---------------------------------------------------------
-----File: p63.png---------------------------------------------------------
The alterations at opposite ends being in opposite
sense. (The normal distribution is shown
by <i>full lines</i> for comparison.) And although
the commencement of the operations is advanced
and retarded by the same amount of
error, operating in opposite sense on opposite
sides of the piston, yet there is a difference in
the work done upon the opposite sides because
of the commencement of the two cycles of
operation at different times, whence we infer
differences in the speeds of the piston, in the
quantities of steam admitted, and in the expansion-curves.

In some cases such a difference is desirable,
and with the working diagram suggested in
Chapter I. another series of results may be
obtained by using the ordinary valve for distribution
on one side of the piston, and for
the other side using a differently-proportioned
valve with a different index-pointer, as though
opposite ends of one valve were differently
proportioned, as in certain large vertical engines.

<i>Adding Extra Lap to a Valve.</i>—In some
cases cut-off may be wanted earlier in the
stroke, permanently, with expansion of longer
duration. Under such circumstances more lap
may be added to the valve. If this be done,
-----File: p64.png---------------------------------------------------------
and the valve with its extra lap be re-set by
giving the eccentric greater advance in order
to get the same lead as before (travel of valve
remaining unaltered), the steam-ports will not
be opened to so great an extent as formerly,
and will close earlier, partly because of the
added lap,[4] and partly because of the increased
advance. The increased length of the valve-face
will, after cut-off, confine the steam longer
in the cylinder, and it should be obvious (the
effect of advancing the eccentric having already
been shown with reference to fig. 32)
that in addition to the earlier commencement
and lengthened duration of expansion, the exhaust
and compression will begin somewhat
earlier because of the increased advance, and
the compression will be of longer duration
because of the increased length of the valve-face.

[Footnote 4: To assure one’s self of this, take an extreme case and
imagine an excessive amount of lap to be added. In such a
case, with travel unaltered, the ports might not be opened to
steam at all, the valve simply sliding backwards and forwards
without uncovering them; now, taking this lap off piecemeal
the port would first be opened to an exceedingly small degree
and instantly shut again, the amount and duration of opening
increasing with each successive removal of lap.]

<i>General.</i>—It is here seen that in altering
either the outside or the inside laps with intent
to affect only the steam admission with the
-----File: p65.png---------------------------------------------------------
former, or only the exhaust with the latter,
we must <i>perforce</i> affect other things. For instance,
we alter the outside lap, with the intention,
say, of simply making cut-off earlier
or later as the case may be—but having altered
the lengths of the valve-faces, they will alter
the duration of expansion and of compression,
and the alteration necessitated in the advance
of the eccentric in order that the lead may
remain unaltered has its own effect in addition.
This interdependence, which is often inconvenient,
is characteristic of the slide valve
worked by an eccentric, and has led to the use
of valve gears and valves which permit, more
or less, of the independent regulation of some
or all of the various operations in the distribution
of steam. Some of these gears are used
with a slide valve (as in the case of the Joy
and other well-known valve gears), while
others operate special valves.

CHAPTER VIII.

NOTE ON LINK MOTIONS.


<i>The Link Motion.</i>—In engines whose duty
<i>frequently</i> varies, as in the familiar case of
a locomotive, permanent alteration of lap
would not meet the requirements of the case,
for the amount of expansion should be susceptible
of ready variation at any time, in accordance
with alterations in the weight of
train, gradients, and weather. The link motion,
in addition to being a reversing gear, is
also a “variable expansion” gear. A precise
analysis of any given case of link motion is
a somewhat difficult operation, but, speaking
broadly, the link motion may be said to provide
what is virtually an eccentric of different
throw and advance for each degree of expansion.
Although, actually, the same two eccentrics
remain constantly in use, the link motion
may be so adjusted as to have an effect on
the valve <i>similar to that which would ensue</i>
-----File: p67.png---------------------------------------------------------
upon the substitution, one for another, of different
eccentrics as stated. Assuming that the
lowest range of expansion is being used, the
valve will have the travel, cut-off, and lead due
for the most part to the throw of the actual
eccentric and to its position with relation to
the crank, almost as in the case of an eccentric
whose rod is directly connected to the valve-spindle;
now, as the link is raised (an operation
sometimes termed “linking-up”) its centre
gets nearer to the block on the end of the
valve-spindle than it was before (<i>i.e.</i>, nearer
to “mid-gear”), and we get in effect:—

/*
<i>With link motion {  A series of eccentrics of decreasing
  having          {    throw, but of
  “open” rods.</i>   {    increasing angular and
                  {    linear advance.

<i>With link motion {  A series of eccentrics of decreasing
  having          {    throw and of
  “crossed”       {    increasing angular, but
  rods.</i>          {    decreasing linear advance;
                  {    throw, therefore,
                  {    decreasing more rapidly
                  {    than in the case of the
                  {    link motion with “open”
                  {    rods.
*/

Take the case of a partially linked-up motion
-----File: p68.png---------------------------------------------------------
with open rods; we shall find that because
the throw of the eccentric is lessened, the
travel of the valve to the right and left of its
central position will be diminished, and the
-----File: p69.png---------------------------------------------------------
ports will not be opened so wide to steam or
exhaust; because of the increased advance of
the eccentric, steam will be cut off earlier,
compression and lead will also be earlier, expansion
and compression lasting longer, and
exhaust and admission being shortened. The
difference between working in full gear and
linked up is shown by the diagram in fig. 34.

*[Illustration: <sc>Fig. 34.</sc>]

Below are diagrams showing the effect of
putting the link motion in “mid-gear” (fig.
-----File: p70.png---------------------------------------------------------
-----File: p71.png---------------------------------------------------------
35) and of putting the link motion into “back
gear” (fig. 36) while the engine is running
ahead, as for a locomotive, but it will be
understood that the effect of the compression
shown in the latter will be modified by the
-----File: p72.png---------------------------------------------------------
lifting of the valve from its face, with the
result that some compressed air and steam will
go up the exhaust.

[Illustration: <sc>Fig. 35.</sc>]

[Illustration: <sc>Fig. 36.</sc>]

The set of diagrams forming fig. 37 is intended
to give a comparative view of the effect
upon the distribution of steam, of differently
arranged valves and eccentrics. The operations
taking place upon only one side of the
piston are shown, except in that section of the
diagram which concerns a shifted valve, in
order to avoid confusion. The upper line of
each diagram, being read from left to right,
shows the operations which take place on the
forward stroke, those of the return stroke being
read from right to left upon the lower portion
of each diagram.

CHAPTER IX.

NOTE ON VERY EARLY CUT-OFF, AND ON REVERSING
GEARS IN GENERAL.


<i>Very early Cut-off.</i>—Theoretically there is no
limit to the range of cut-off which may be obtained
from an ordinary slide valve, but a
moment’s consideration will show that if we
require a valve to cut off steam very early in
the stroke of the piston so as to cause it to expand
throughout an increased fraction of that
stroke, the <i>lap</i> must be considerably increased
beyond that which is usual, if the valve-face
is to be enabled to keep the steam confined in
the cylinder for a sufficient period after cut-off
is effected.

As a consequence of increased lap, the <i>travel</i>
of the valve, made up of <i>lap plus the required
port-opening</i>, will need to be increased correspondingly;
the <i>linear advance</i> (the sum of lead
plus an <i>increased</i> lap) will be increased also,
and the valve will therefore come back earlier
-----File: p74.png---------------------------------------------------------
into its central position (where compression begins)
than would the normal valve, so making
compression begin earlier and last longer than
before. In an unbalanced valve, this increased
travel, together with the abnormal compression,
cannot be tolerated, so that for obtaining
an early cut-off without too much compression,
with a sliding valve, gear of the “separate
cut-off slide,” or Meyer type, is employed.
This is characterised by a cut-off
plate or plates on the back of a main slide
valve, which may have the usual exhaust
cavity, and in addition possesses supply steam-conduits
leading through the valve from the
back to the “lap-edges” (fig. 38). Exhaust
and compression are timed by the edges of the
central exhaust cavity; lead is given by the
“lap-edges,” but cut-off is controlled by movement
of the cut-off plates on the back of the
moving main valve, so that though a “lap-edge”
-----File: p75.png---------------------------------------------------------
may not at any time have closed one of
the steam-ports proper, a cut-off plate worked
by a separate eccentric can close the appropriate
steam-conduit above referred to, and so
stop the current of steam flowing past the
lap-edge to the still open port. Moreover, by
a suitable setting of the eccentrics of the main
and cut-off valves, it is possible to arrange that,
at the instant of cut-off, the two valves shall
be moving in opposite directions, and so shall
effect a sharp cut-off, whereby wire-drawing
is reduced.

*[Illustration: <sc>Fig. 38.</sc>—Slide Valve, with Cut-off Plate on back.]

With the model referred to in the earlier
chapters, the action of a Meyer or similar gear
can be readily investigated if an extra eccentric-arm
be added to the crank-pin disc and
an extra travel-scale marked upon the base-*plate.

In fig. 39 is shown the “Buckeye” valve
used in America on the Buckeye engine; <i>a</i> is
the main valve, which determines the admission,
release and compression of the steam;
and <i>b</i> is the small auxiliary valve which rides
on the top of the main valve <i>a</i>, and which effects
the cut-off. This valve is constructed so
as to have all the advantages of a perfectly
balanced valve as well as those of the Meyer
valve. There are two faces between which the
-----File: p76.png---------------------------------------------------------
-----File: p77.png---------------------------------------------------------
main valve slides steam tight, and the small
valve works on a face inside of the main valve,
as shown in the figure. Steam is exhausted
past the outer edges of the main valve. In
order that steam may enter the cylinder, the
port in the main valve must be in communication
with the steam port and at the same time
it must not be covered by the auxiliary valve <i>b</i>.
In the figure the valves are shown in such a
position as to admit steam to the left-hand end
of the cylinder and to allow it to exhaust from
the right-hand end, as indicated by the arrows.

[Illustration: <sc>Fig. 39.</sc>—The Buckeye Valve.]

Each valve is moved by its own eccentric,
quite independently of the other. By changing
the advance or eccentricity, or both, of the
auxiliary valve, the cut-off may be changed as
desired, without in any way affecting the motion
of the main valve. And as the main valve
determines the admission, release, and compression
of the steam, it is possible, with this
valve, to change the cut-off as desired without
affecting these at all.

<i>The Trick or Allen Valve.</i>—In connection
with the subject of early cut-offs the Trick or
Allen valve may be mentioned. It is made
with a passage-way through the back of the
valve, as shown in fig. 40, adapted to deliver
an extra supply of steam into the port by rendering
-----File: p78.png---------------------------------------------------------
available an additional proportion of
the area thereof, when the narrow port-opening
given by the lap-edge alone, during
linked-up working, is found to wire-draw the
steam. Whilst the lap-edge <i>a</i>, for instance,
uncovers the edge <i>b</i> of the right-hand port,
the left-hand end of the Trick passage becomes
uncovered by moving beyond the edge <i>c</i> of the
port-face, so that a current of steam flows
from left to right through that passage to join
the stream passing the edge <i>a</i>. The total area
of the two supply-streams flowing into the
right-hand port being practically twice that
which would be available were the Trick passage
absent.

[Illustration: <sc>Fig. 40.</sc>]

The occurrence and duration of the operations
of steam-distribution are exactly the same
with this valve as with an ordinary slide-valve
of corresponding proportions, the distinctive
-----File: p79.png---------------------------------------------------------
feature of the valve having no effect upon them
so far as their timing is concerned.

<i>Reversal.</i>—It may be of interest to consider
the question—“Why do we need <i>reversing</i>
gears?” The gears in common use are nearly
all variable expansion gears, as well as being
<i>reversing</i> gears, but it is desired to consider
now only the question of reversing. Are reversing
gears really needed? Suppose that
one could have a transparent cylinder and
valve-chest, so that movement of the piston
and valve could be clearly seen. Suppose
also that the connecting-rod, crank, valve gear,
and fly-wheel could <i>not</i> be seen. We look into
the cylinder and see valve and piston reciprocating
regularly, and in harmony with one
another. We turn away, and before we look
again, the engine, let us assume, has been reversed
without our knowledge; yet when we
turn again to the engine there are the piston
and valve reciprocating just as they were at
first (<i>although they must have “changed
step,” as we shall presently find</i>), and, look as
intently as we may, with nothing else visible
we shall be unable to tell that the engine has
been reversed. The valve is doing now exactly
what it did before, performing its operations
in the same order. Why have we had to employ
-----File: p80.png---------------------------------------------------------
reversing gear? Solely because—when
the engine ceases to run <i>ahead</i> for instance,
stopping at half-stroke the piston and valve
will be in a certain position, and will have been
moving in certain directions relatively to one
another. And to reverse the <i>piston’s</i> motion,
we want the valve

<i>Firstly</i>—To take up a new position on the
port-face, so as, for example, to give steam
where it had previously given exhaust, and
thus we get reversal of the <i>engine</i>; and

<i>Secondly</i>—To move away from that new
position, after the engine has started astern,
in the same direction as that in which it was
moving when the engine was running ahead.
And seeing that the valve gear derives motion
from the crank-shaft directly or indirectly, we
cannot give the valve motion in this <i>same</i> direction
from an engine now moving reversely,
unless we also reverse the <i>gear</i>. And thus we
may conclude that a reversing gear is needed
simply for the purpose of regulating the direction
of the first motion of the valve after
stopping (<i>i.e.</i>, for “changing the step”), for
after it next reaches the end of its travel its
motion will be in all respects just as it was
when the engine ran ahead,—so that, if we
had a single-cylinder engine and never stopped
-----File: p81.png---------------------------------------------------------
it except on the dead centres, we could drive
its valve <i>by a separate valve-engine always
running one way</i>, and our main engine would,
if pushed off by hand, run equally well either
ahead or astern, whilst served by a valve having
lap, lead, and travel as is customary. It
is hoped that this little speculation may not
appear unprofitable, for it has a bearing on the
action of the reversing slides in radial valve
gears such as those of Hackworth, Walschaert,
and Joy.
